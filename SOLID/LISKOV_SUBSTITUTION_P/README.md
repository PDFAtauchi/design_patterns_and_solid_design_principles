# Liskov Substitution Principle

## Concept

- When a child class cannot perform the same actions as its parent class, this can cause bugs.
- If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program.
- Subclasses must respect the Liskov substitution principle
- The LSP dictates that everything true for the class, must be true for the subclass
